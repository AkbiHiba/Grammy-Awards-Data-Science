# How to Win a Grammy

---

The Grammy Awards are one of the most prestigious music awards, where singers, songwriters, and producers compete for the best title and recognition of the year. Beyond its musical significance, the Grammys also garner huge media attention. In light of the importance of such an event, as well as the subjectivity of the voting process, utilizing data-driven techniques can help uncover patterns, possible biases, and trends.

## Project Objectives

In this work, we explore the question "**How to Win A Grammy?**" with three core objectives:

1.  To **understand the features** that differentiate the status of a song.
2.  To **uncover Grammy trends** and how they compare to Billboard.
3.  To **develop a model** that is able to accurately and reliably predict winners from nominees.

## Key Findings

Our analysis yielded several interesting results:

* **Chart Performance:** The longevity of a song on the charts and its debut rank are important, but not strict requirements for a Grammy win.
* **Rap Song Divergence:** Winning rap songs tend to diverge in their topics from the trends of average rap songs.
* **Release Date**: October appears to be an ideal release month for Grammy-winning songs, allowing sufficient time for commercial success and an opportunity to climb charts. Conversely, songs released in winter or late summer (closer to the submission deadline) tend to experience less success.
* **Geographical & Linguistic Dominance:** The US dominates both the Grammys and the Billboard charts, with English songs also leading in both. While Spanish songs have seen a rise in popularity, particularly starting from 2022, they still rarely make it to the Grammy Awards. Additionally, there is a strong correlation found between a robust musical infrastructure in US states and producing of more Grammy winners and nominees.
* **Industry Trends:** Our trend analysis shows that the music industry is getting more vulgar over time, and more negative songs are being favored. Additionally, it appears more female artists are getting nominated with time showcasing an effort to promote gender diversity .
* **Predictive Model:** Our model achieved excellent performance and was accurately and reliably able to distinguish between winning and non-winning classes.

## Limitations and Future Work

However, limitations remain due to inherent biases, such as **selection bias** and **missing data bias**, which could impact the generalizability of our findings. Future improvements, such as incorporating a wider range of data sources, could be used to tackle these challenges and further enhance our understanding of "How to Win a Grammy."
