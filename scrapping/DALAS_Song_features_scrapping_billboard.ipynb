In our unique_songs data, the artist column sometimes include artist featuring (ex: Fuerza Regida & Grupo Frontera) or (Santana Featuring Rob Thomas). We will do a simple split to separate between the main artist that we will keep in \"Artist\" column, and the secondary artists if any, that we will store in \"Feat\" column. We will use regex, because sometimes the splitting can be tricky. For example, we can have \"A & B\", \"A feat. B\", \"A featuring B\" or even when there are mutliple artists \"A & B featurign C\" or \"A featuring B & C\". We also have other variants : \"A x B\", \"A X B\", \"A With B\" ...etc . In any case, we are interested in the main artists only, we will then get the exact other contributers throughthe spotify API if the song is found.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":283},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":60,"status":"error","timestamp":1740533290525,"user":{"displayName":"Hiba
